...I lost.
It would appear that I was ill prepared.

No way... I can understand Hideyoshi,
but how could the class rep and I
lose?!

Yuuji will be sad to find out that
I failed him here.

Akihisa Yoshii
Uh... I'm not so sure about that.
He might actually be grateful.

Shouko Kirishima
No. He will be sad.

Akihisa Yoshii
Y-Yeah. Right. Sad...

Next match, it'll be me and Yuuji.
The bonds of our love will lead us
to victory.

Akihisa Yoshii
Wait, next match...? Hold on a minute!
...And she's gone.

Yuuko Kinoshita
Hand in hand with Sakamoto,
passionately fighting for the sake of
their love... Sounds kinda fun.

Akihisa Yoshii
That doesn't sound fun!
...Wait, did you mean the part about
being hand in hand with Yuuji?!

Yuuko Kinoshita
Yeah. Though, if he doesn't want to
hold hands with the class rep, maybe
could hold hands with... Hideyoshi?

Akihisa Yoshii
Why would Yuuji be holding hands with
Hideyoshi?! Though, I wouldn't mind
holding hands with Hideyoshi, myself.

Hideyoshi Kinoshita
Why is that the part you latch on to?!
I don't even swing that way. You'd do
best to just ignore her weird fantas-

Yuuko Kinoshita
Hideyoshi, could you come here a sec?

Hideyoshi Kinoshita
Aaaaaah!
Save me, Akihisa!

Akihisa Yoshii
Sorry, Hideyoshi. I try not to get
involved in other people's family
matters.

Hideyoshi Kinoshita
Hey, Sis! Where are you taking me?!
Wherever it is, I don't wanna go!
