Akihisa Yoshii
It's good to see you,
Himeji!


Page 1
Mizuki Himeji
I'm glad to see you too,
Akihisa.


Page 2
Akihisa Yoshii
Minami, is it really okay for you to 
slack off in a place like this?


Page 3
Minami Shimada
I could ask you the same thing.



Page 4
Akihisa Yoshii
Hm, who are you again?
Yuuji, was it?


Page 5
Yuuji Sakamoto
What do you mean, who am I?!


Page 6
Akihisa Yoshii
Hideyoshi, you've been
waiting here just for me!


Page 7
Hideyoshi Kinoshita
I'm not waiting for anyone.
You're sadly mistaken.


Page 8
Akihisa Yoshii
Kouta, what are you doing
hanging around here?


Page 9
Kouta Tsuchiya
Independent study.


Page 10
Akihisa Yoshii
Sorry, Shouko, but I'm not Yuuji.



Page 11
Shouko Kirishima
Obviously.


Page 12
Akihisa Yoshii
Huh? Oh, Yuuko, you're
here too.


Page 13
Yuuko Kinoshita
Is that a problem?


Page 14
Akihisa Yoshii
Y-Yo, Miharu.
What a coincidence!


Page 15
Miharu Shimizu
Don't talk to me like
we're friends, pig.


Page 16
Akihisa Yoshii
Himeji, will you battle me?



Page 17
Mizuki Himeji
I'd be happy to. But I'm not
going to hold back, okay?


Page 18
Akihisa Yoshii
Let's go, Minami!


Page 19
Minami Shimada
Anytime! I'll turn the
tables on you!


Page 20
Akihisa Yoshii
If it's Yuuji, even I might be
able to win...


Page 21
Yuuji Sakamoto
Hey, Akihisa. How many 
times is this now?


Page 22
Akihisa Yoshii
Hideyoshi, I'll be taking this
equipment!


Page 23
Hideyoshi Kinoshita
You're gravely mistaken if
you think I'll just give it up.


Page 24
Akihisa Yoshii
Kouta! Let's fight,
man to man!


Page 25
Kouta Tsuchiya
Challenge accepted.


Page 26
Akihisa Yoshii
Shouko, fight me!



Page 27
Shouko Kirishima
...Very well. But the outcome
is already clear.


Page 28
Akihisa Yoshii
A formidable foe... but I
have no choice!


Page 29
Yuuko Kinoshita
You're like a moth flying into
the flame, aren't you?


Page 30
Akihisa Yoshii
Shimizu, let's battle!


Page 31
Miharu Shimizu
I'll grind you up in a matter of
seconds.


Page 32
Akihisa Yoshii
Sorry, Himeji.


Page 33
Mizuki Himeji
Well, congratulations,
Akihisa.


Page 34
Souichi Nishimura
Himeji, you know the rules.
Time for a remedial class.


Page 35
Mizuki Himeji
Yes, of course.



Page 36
Akihisa Yoshii
I win, Minami!


Page 37
Minami Shimada
To think I could lose to
Aki...


Page 38
Souichi Nishimura
Those who died with a score of zero,
meet me in the remedial classroom!


Page 39
Minami Shimada
To think I could lose to
Aki...


Page 40
Akihisa Yoshii
You see that, Yuuji? This is
my true strength!


Page 41
Yuuji Sakamoto
I've never been so humiliated
in my life...

Page 42
Souichi Nishimura
Those who died, meet me in the
remedial classroom!

Page 43
Yuuji Sakamoto
Damn... Why do I have to
waste my time there...?


Page 44
Akihisa Yoshii
Hideyoshi, this equipment is 
mine!


Page 45
Hideyoshi Kinoshita
I'll remember this, Akihisa!


Page 46
Souichi Nishimura
Those who died, meet me in the
remedial classroom!

Page 47
Hideyoshi Kinoshita
I know, I know. You don't
have to yell that every time...


Page 48
Akihisa Yoshii
Better luck next time.



Page 49
Kouta Tsuchiya
I failed...


Page 50
Souichi Nishimura
Those who died, meet me in the
remedial classroom!

Page 51
Kouta Tsuchiya
I'd like to skip that, if possible.



Page 52
Akihisa Yoshii
It's a miracle...!



Page 53
Shouko Kirishima
I won't lose next time.


Page 54
Souichi Nishimura
Kirishima, you know the rules.
Time for a remedial class.


Page 55
Shouko Kirishima
I'll be back soon.



Page 56
Akihisa Yoshii
I did it! This is what they call
a giant killing!


Page 57
Yuuko Kinoshita
Do you even realize that you
just admitted you're an idiot?


Page 58
Souichi Nishimura
Kinoshita, meet me in the
remedial classroom!

Page 59
Yuuko Kinoshita
Understood.


Page 60
Akihisa Yoshii
I beat Shimizu!


Page 61
Miharu Shimizu
You pig! What have 
you done!?


Page 62
Souichi Nishimura
Shimizu, meet me in the
remedial classroom!

Page 63
Miharu Shimizu
Whaa?! No way!


Page 64
Akihisa Yoshii
Phew, looks like I somehow
managed to hold out.


Page 65
Akihisa Yoshii
Principal! You don't need
to be here!


Page 66
Kaoru Toudou
Don't worry, I'm just here to
stir things up a bit.


Page 67
Akihisa Yoshii
She just did whatever she
wanted and left...


Page 68
Akihisa Yoshii
Yeah! This is a good card!



Page 69
Akihisa Yoshii
Wh-What!?


Page 70
Akihisa Yoshii
Alright! I'm going to try my best
and aim for the top!


Page 71
Akihisa Yoshii
Just a little more till this match
is over...


Page 72
Akihisa Yoshii
I won't give up until the very end.



Page 73
Akihisa Yoshii
If I can keep this up, I still
have a shot at winning!


Page 74
Akihisa Yoshii
I'm going to go bankrupt 
at this rate...


Page 75
Akihisa Yoshii
My food budget... Oh wait,
it's just virtual money.


Page 76
Akihisa Yoshii
All the equipment in this area
belongs to me!


Page 77
Akihisa Yoshii
Just when I got a monopoly on
that area...


Page 78
Akihisa Yoshii
Alright! I've collected all
of this type of equipment.


Page 79
Akihisa Yoshii
Aaah! I went through all that trouble
to collect them all, too...


Page 80
Akihisa Yoshii
How long do I have to wait
to get a decent spin?!


Page 81
Akihisa Yoshii
There's gotta be some kinda
trick to this, right?!


Page 82
Akihisa Yoshii
I'm feeling kinda lucky
today.


Page 83
Akihisa Yoshii
Don't panic. Don't panic.


Page 84
Akihisa Yoshii
You know what they say,
Slow and steady, just in case.


Page 85
Akihisa Yoshii
Maybe I should rest here for a turn.


Page 86
Akihisa Yoshii
Well, if Himeji is here too,
I guess that's fine.


Page 87
Mizuki Himeji
I-If Akihisa and I are here
together...


Page 88
Akihisa Yoshii
Striker Sigma V
does it again!


Page 89
Akihisa Yoshii
I thought I'd get a
higher score than this...


Page 90
Akihisa Yoshii
Oh well, that's just how it is.
It's no big deal.


Page 91
Akihisa Yoshii
Hey, you can't do that!
That's not fair!


Page 92
Akihisa Yoshii
Huh? What just happened?



Page 93
Akihisa Yoshii
Aaah! My score was already
pathetically low!


Page 94
Akihisa Yoshii
Stealing a student's cash?
How greedy can you get?!


Page 95
Akihisa Yoshii
Huh? You're moving me?
Where am I?


Page 96
Akihisa Yoshii
Aaah! That was going
to be my trump card!


Page 97
Akihisa Yoshii
Did that price just go up?!
