Mizuki Himeji
O-Ok! I'm going to begin the
explanation! Everyone, please take
your seats!


Page 1
Minami Shimada
Aki, get on the floor!


Page 2
Akihisa Yoshii
Haha, very funny.


Page 3
Akihisa Yoshii
Wait... You really want me to kneel?!


Page 4
Kouta Tsuchiya
Just do what she says. It's our fate as
men to obey...


Page 5
Yuuji Sakamoto
Those suits sure make them look
intimidating.


Page 6
Kouta Tsuchiya
The glasses, too.
They really bring the look together.


Page 7
Mizuki Himeji
What's the matter, everyone?
Why are you looking at us like that?


Page 8
Male Student
Himeji, could you try looking stricter?
And don't be nice. Abuse us all you
want!


Page 9
Akihisa Yoshii
What kind of guy would ask Himeji
to do something like that?!


Page 10
Akihisa Yoshii
I could understand asking to marry her...
But begging for abuse? I can't stand
for that!


Page 11
Kouta Tsuchiya
You could always share.


Page 12
Akihisa Yoshii
Wait, what?
I think you've got the wrong idea.


Page 13
Kouta Tsuchiya
To the contrary.
I had you pegged as a masochist from
the start.


Page 14
Akihisa Yoshii
No way! I may be an idiot, but I am
definitely not a masochist!


Page 15
Yuuji Sakamoto
It must've felt pretty good disobeying
Shimada earlier, huh?


Page 16
Akihisa Yoshii
Well... I could see getting addicted to
that feeling of freedom. Especially
when... No, I'm not like that at all!


Page 17
Hideyoshi Kinoshita
Akihisa does seem to have a thing for
suffering.


Page 18
Akihisa Yoshii
I told you already! I'm no masochist!
Yuuji is more of a masochist than me!
Just look at him and Shou-


Page 19
Minami Shimada
For the last time, Aki, get on the floor!


Page 20
(Stage Directions)
Let's go back a bit, to when this all
began.


Page 21
Kaoru Toudou
I don't have much time, so I'll be brief.
Starting today, you will be testing a 
new summoner system.


Page 22
Kaoru Toudou
Because of the large gap in test scores,
I think you'll agree that this change in
system will be to your advantage.


Page 23
Kaoru Toudou
Now, I'll go over the rules.
I'll only explain these once, so listen
carefully.


Page 24
Akihisa & Yuuji
What the hell was that?!


Page 25
Akihisa Yoshii
Now what? Did anyone get any of that?


Page 26
Hideyoshi Kinoshita
That's too bad. I guess we'll just have
to figure things out as we go.


Page 27
Yuuji Sakamoto
I understood that we're testing some
kind of new Summoner Test System...
But then I got lost.


Page 28
Yuuji Sakamoto
But if any of us understood the whole
thing, it'd have to be...


Page 29
Mizuki Himeji
U-Um... perhaps...


Page 30
Akihisa Yoshii
It'd be Himeji, of course!


Page 31
Yuuji Sakamoto
In that case, Himeji, would you mind
helping out the rest of us idiots?

Page 32
Mizuki Himeji
Of course. I think it will help if we use
the blackboard.


Page 33
Minami Shimada
I'll help too!


Page 34
Mizuki Himeji
Thank you very much, Minami.
Could you start by writing this on the
blackboard for me?


Page 35
Minami Shimada
Let's see... You will be using virtual
currency to... Oh no! I'm getting chalk
all over my clothes...


Page 36
Mizuki Himeji
Oh, I am too...


Page 37
Kouta Tsuchiya
In that case, try these.


Page 38
Minami Shimada
What are these? Suits?


Page 39
Kouta Tsuchiya
If you're going to be teaching, you
should look the part.


Page 40
Mizuki Himeji
But wouldn't it be worse if we got these
suits dirty?


Page 41
Kouta Tsuchiya
Don't worry about it. 
The dirtier, the better...


Page 42
Minami Shimada
What do you think, Mizuki?


Page 43
Mizuki Himeji
I don't know...


Page 44
Kouta Tsuchiya
Th-They're...!


Page 45
Minami Shimada
We decided we'd wear them.
And we added glasses too!


Page 46
Mizuki Himeji
Well, Kouta insisted, and we just
couldn't refuse...
I think it really suits you, Minami.


Page 47
Minami Shimada
Y-You do?
...What do you think, Aki?


Page 48
Akihisa Yoshii
(Of course it looks great on her.
And that short skirt is really showing
off her legs...)


Page 49
Akihisa Yoshii
But compared to Himeji's figure, the
lacking in the breast department is,
how to say it... super disappointing-

Page 50
Minami Shimada
I'll show you disappointing!


Page 51
Akihisa Yoshii
M-M-M-Minami! Stop! Judo's against
the rules! O-Okay, I give! Uncle! Uncle
uncle uncle uncle!!


Page 52
Akihisa Yoshii
Aaaaaaaaaghhhhh!


Page 53
Akihisa Yoshii
...And so, we come back to the present.
I was ready to listen to the explanation,
but I ended up in that big mess...


Page 54
Yuuji Sakamoto
No wonder. It's because you were
perving on their suits.


Page 55
Akihisa Yoshii
Th-That's...! Ok, yes, you're right,
but... You were too, Yuuji!


Page 56
???
Is that so?


Page 57
Yuuji Sakamoto
What the hell?! Can you can read
minds now?!


Page 58
Shouko Kirishima
Yuuji, affairs will not be tolerated.
You're not allowed to look at anyone
but me.


Page 59
Yuuji Sakamoto
Grrrr... Why are you even here, Shouko?
Shouldn't you be over in Class A?


Page 60
Yuuko Kinoshita
We came over to let you know how
incredibly loud you were, and... Uh...
Himeji, Shimada, what's with the suits?


Page 61
Kouta Tsuchiya
Perfect. The femme fatale herself
came too.


Page 62
Shouko Kirishima
I understand.
If that's what you like, Yuuji, then I'll
just have to join them.


Page 63
Kouta Tsuchiya
...Hngh! Nnngh! Nnnnnghh...!


Page 64
Akihisa Yoshii
Wow, she looks like a real teacher!
It's almost too perfect!


Page 65
Shouko Kirishima
Yuuji, it's okay to look.
Come closer.


Page 66
Yuuji Sakamoto
Come closer?!
Himeji, could you hurry it up with that
explanation?


Page 67
Mizuki Himeji
O-Of course! I'll start right away.
Alright everyone, please give the
blackboard your attention.


Page 68
Mizuki Himeji
Here, I've written each of the key points
that we are going to cover.


Page 69
Mizuki Himeji
First, you will be given an allowance
of virtual currency to buy and sell
equipment that you need to collect.



Page 70
Mizuki Himeji
However, this equipment can also be
taken by fighting each other with your
avatars.


Page 71
Minami Shimada
Instead of the usual class-wide Wars,
four people from any class will be able
to face off in a single match.


Page 72
Shouko Kirishima
Furthermore, any player that manages
to win three times in a row will
receive a prize.


Page 73
Mizuki Himeji
From what I was able to hear before,
it sounded like the prize will be chosen
exclusively by and for the winner.


Page 74
Akihisa Yoshii
Seriously?
Can we really pick anything we want?!



Page 75
Mizuki Himeji
Right. I think that's what the Principal
meant when she said that the change
in system would be to our advantage.


Page 76
Minami Shimada
But, we need to win three times in a
row to win the prize, right?
I doubt I could pull that off.


Page 77
Miharu Shimizu
But I could! I'll do my very best just for
you! Did you miss me, baby?


Page 78
Minami Shimada
W-Why are you here, Miharu?!
Shouldn't you be in Class D?


Page 79
Miharu Shimizu
Wherever my lover goes, so shall I
follow! That's how you know I love
you so much, my little honey bunch!


Page 80
Minami Shimada
Stalking me is not a hobby, so
cut it out already!


Page 81
Miharu Shimizu
No way! I know you love me, baby!
Just last night, in my dreams, you told
me over and over again...


Page 82
Minami Shimada
I would never! How many times do
I have to tell you? I don't swing
that way!

Page 83
Akihisa Yoshii
Minami and Miharu are just as close
as ever, huh?
Oh, right! About that prize...


Page 84
Yuuji Sakamoto
Winning three times in a row is quite
the tall order, but it seems pretty
appropriate for that kind of reward.


Page 85
Akihisa Yoshii
What do you think, Kouta?
...Kouta?

Page 86
Kouta Tsuchiya
......
*drip* *drip* *drip*


Page 87
Akihisa Yoshii
Ah, classic Kouta. Looks like he's
already lost in his fantasies. No doubt
he's going to be trying for the top.


Page 88
Mizuki Himeji
I-I will too!
There's something I want right now,
but I don't have enough money for it...


Page 89
Minami Shimada
If everyone's trying, then I will too.
Say, Aki, what prize would you want
if you won?


Page 90
Akihisa Yoshii
Hmmm, I haven't decided.
Too bad not all of us can win.


Page 91
Yuuji Sakamoto
Oho... Don't tell me, Akihisa, that you
actually think you could beat me?


Page 92
Akihisa Yoshii
Of course. I don't plan to lose.


Page 93
Miharu Shimizu
No way! I'm gonna win! And when I do,
my Cuddle Bunny will finally realize
how she really feels about me!


Page 94
Shouko Kirishima
If we're talking about the depths of our
love, mine is the deepest, so I cannot
lose.


Page 95
Mizuki Himeji
I definitely won't lose!
I'm going to try my best so I can help
the person I love!


Page 96
Hideyoshi Kinoshita
Looks like this war is going to be
pretty intense. I hope everything
goes smoothly.


Page 97
Akihisa Yoshii
Yeah! This war might even bring an end
to someone's hopelessly flat ches-Ow
ow ow! My legs don't bend that waaaay!


Page 98
(Stage Directions)
And so, the opening act came to a
close as the curtains began to rise on
our rather unusual Summoner Test War.
