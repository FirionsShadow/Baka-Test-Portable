Pardon the intrusion.

Hm? You're...

Hideyoshi Kinoshita, Class F.
I'd like to ask some questions
regarding the prize this time.


Page 3
Kaoru Toudou
I heard one of you brats tried
asking for a mini satellite.
That wouldn't be you, would it?


Page 4
Hideyoshi Kinoshita
I don't want something so extravagant.
All I want is the iron bracelet.


Page 5
Kaoru Toudou
I'll see what I can do. Is that all?
Wait a minute, can you even use it?


Page 6
Hideyoshi Kinoshita
No, but I'd like to try, anyway.
I'm sure if I use it, I can improve my fighting ability.
I don't want to be a burden in battles any longer.


Page 7
Kaoru Toudou
You're not so bad, for a brat.
But I doubt that little toy will help you.


Page 8
Kaoru Toudou
Alright.
If that's all you want, you can have it,
but only if your battle results show promise.


Page 9
Hideyoshi Kinoshita
Will do.


Page 10
Kaoru Toudou
Good luck.

Yuuko Kinoshita
Huh? Hideyoshi?
What are you doing here?


Page 12
Hideyoshi Kinoshita
Hey, sis.
I went to see the principal.
I wanted to ask her about my prize.


Page 13
Yuuko Kinoshita
Wow. What did you ask for?


Page 14
Hideyoshi Kinoshita
What do you want, sis?


Page 15
Yuuko Kinoshita
I haven't made my mind up.
But don't avoid the question! Tell me.


Page 16
Hideyoshi Kinoshita
Well...


Page 17
Hideyoshi Kinoshita
(Ugh... It'd be embarrassing if I told her
that I want the iron bracelet to help everyone...)



Page 18
Yuuko Kinoshita
Come on! Tell me already.


Page 19
Hideyoshi Kinoshita
It's no big deal, really...
I just want a bracelet.


Page 20
Yuuko Kinoshita
What did you say?!


Page 21
Yuuko Kinoshita
(That reminds me... This sounds just like
something I saw in a manga, recently.)

Page 22
Yuuko Kinoshita
(A handsome prince asks his boyfriend what
he wants for his birthday... And he softly
replies with 'I just want a bracelet'.)


Page 23
Yuuko Kinoshita
(He was even blushing like she is.
That's it! This is my chance.)


Page 24
Hideyoshi Kinoshita
What's wrong, sis?
Your face is looking a little red...


Page 25
Yuuko Kinoshita
W-W-What are you talking about?!
But you... you're...?


Page 26
Hideyoshi Kinoshita
What was that?


Page 27
Yuuko Kinoshita
(I never thought I'd be embarrassed by him...)


Page 28
Hideyoshi Kinoshita
Sis, is everything okay?
You didn't get food poisoning, did you?


Page 29
Yuuko Kinoshita
My stomach's fine.
Just tell me, Hideyoshi...
Who is that prize for?


Page 30
Hideyoshi Kinoshita
Huh? Well uh... You know...
I'll tell you later.
Break a leg, big sis!


Page 31
Yuuko Kinoshita
Hideyoshi, get back here!
I'm not done with you yet!


Page 32
Yuuko Kinoshita
Whatever.
I'll get him next time.


Page 33
Yuuko Kinoshita
I just...
Can't believe he has someone he likes.


Page 34
Kouta Tsuchiya
Whoa, this is big news!


Page 35
Akihisa Yoshii
Whoever they are, I'll never forgive them!
They can have Hideyoshi... Over my dead body!



Page 36
Yuuko Kinoshita
How long have you two been there?!


Page 37
Kouta Tsuchiya
About when Hideyoshi went into the principal's office.


Page 38
Yuuko Kinoshita
Isn't that considered stalking?


Page 39
Kouta Tsuchiya
...No.


Page 40
Yuuko Kinoshita
Whatever...
I don't have time to argue with you.
What do you guys think about this?


Page 41
Akihisa Yoshii
I reject this reality!


Page 42
Kouta Tsuchiya
Agreed.
If Hideyoshi were really in a relationship, it would
make a lot of paying... a lot of people unhappy.


Page 43
Yuuko Kinoshita
If that's true, then we have to stop Hideyoshi
from winning that prize at any cost!



Page 44
Yuuko Kinoshita
I'll never accept Hideyoshi dating before me!
I mean, I am his older sister.


Page 45
Akihisa Yoshii
I can't believe someone seduced Hideyoshi...
What kind of man would stoop that low?!


Page 46
Kouta Tsuchiya
We definitely have to get to the bottom of this.
