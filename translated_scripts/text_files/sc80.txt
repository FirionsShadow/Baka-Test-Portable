...Yoshii, where’s Yuuji?


Page 1
Akihisa Yoshii
Sorry, Kirishima. I 
have no idea.


Page 2
Shouko Kirishima
...Mizuki, what’re you
aiming for?


Page 3
Mizuki Himeji
Cooking utensils!


Page 4
Shouko Kirishima
...What’s your goal?


Page 5
Minami Shimada
That’s confidential. We
are now rivals after all.


Page 6
Shouko Kirishima
Yuuji, you don’t have to be
shy.


Page 7
Yuuji Sakamoto
Wh-who’s being shy!?
Hey! Stay away!


Page 8
Shouko Kirishima
...I thought you were
Yuuko.




Page 9
Hideyoshi Kinoshita
I’m a guy. 
Please don’t ever forget that.


Page 10
Shouko Kirishima
...Tsuchiya. I’ll buy Yuuji’s
photo if you have it.


Page 11
Kouta Tsuchiya
...Regrettably. It’s out of stock.


Page 12
Shouko Kirishima
...Yuuko... How’re you feeling?


Page 13
Yuuko Kinoshita
Just like this. I’m not 
giving up though.


Page 14
Shouko Kirishima
...Do you know Yuuji?


Page 15
Miharu Shimizu
Not interested!


Page 16
Shouko Kirishima
...  let’s duel.


Page 17
Akihisa Yoshii
Kirishima is the opponent!?
It’s a lost cause already...


Page 18
Shouko Kirishima
...please be my battle
opponent.


Page 19
Mizuki Himeji
Yes, I understand.
I’m in your care.


Page 20
Shouko Kirishima
...let’s duel.


Page 21
Minami Shimada
The opponent is Kirishima?
It’ll be a little intense.


Page 22
Shouko Kirishima
...Yuuji, fight me..


Page 23
Yuuji Sakamoto
Alright! You’re the only
one that I won’t lose to!


Page 24
Shouko Kirishima
...I’ll be taking that equipment.


Page 25
Hideyoshi Kinoshita
I’m up against Kirishima!?
Ugh...I’m troubled.


Page 26
Shouko Kirishima
...I’ll have you hand over
This equipment.




Page 27
Kouta Tsuchiya
...Don’t mock me.


Page 28
Shouko Kirishima
Yuuko...fight me.


Page 29
Yuuko Kinoshita
I won’t hold back even if
the opponent is the class rep.


Page 30
Shouko Kirishima
...This equipment is
mine.


Page 31
Miharu Shimizu
You won’t pass! 
Even if I have to stop you by force!


Page 32
Shouko Kirishima
... it’s my victory.


Page 33
Akihisa Yoshii
Ugh...it has to come to 
this after all...


Page 34
Souichi Nishimura
Supplementary class for the loser!
Train hard and try again!




Page 35
Akihisa Yoshii
Th-that’s not necessary!


Page 36
Shouko Kirishima
...the difference was 
Paper-thin but I’ve won.


Page 37
Mizuki Himeji
As expected of Kirishima,
I lost completely.


Page 38
Souichi Nishimura
In that case, stop being in denial!
Himeji, loser to the supplementary class.


Page 39
Mizuki Himeji
Understood. I’ll do my
best!


Page 40
Shouko Kirishima
...the match’s decided.


Page 41
Minami Shimada
Ahhh...a lost just as
expected.




Page 42
Souichi Nishimura
But, win next the one!
Supplement yourself with supplementary class!


Page 43
Minami Shimada
This can’t be helped…
I understand.


Page 44
Shouko Kirishima
...I’ll offer this win to 
Yuuji.


Page 45
Yuuji Sakamoto
Don’t offer a victory
that is won from me!


Page 46
Souichi Nishimura
Don’t ever forget that humiliation!
Now, start with supplementary class!


Page 47
Yuuji Sakamoto
Good grief. It just has 
to be now...!


Page 48
Shouko Kirishima
...Victory is mine.


Page 49
Hideyoshi Kinoshita
As I thought, I am no
match for her.


Page 50
Souichi Nishimura
If that’s the case, polish your ability!
Kinoshita, to the supplementary class!


Page 51
Hideyoshi Kinoshita
Well then, I should hurry
Up and get on with it.


Page 52
Shouko Kirishima
...match ends.


Page 53
Kouta Tsuchiya
...I’ll clear this shame next time.


Page 54
Souichi Nishimura
However, before that, 
Loser to the supplementary class!


Page 55
Kouta Tsuchiya
...got it. I’ll just head to 
The supplementary classroom.


Page 56
Shouko Kirishima
...Yuuko, I won.


Page 57
Yuuko Kinoshita
I’m defeated. As expected
of the class rep.


Page 58
Souichi Nishimura
But, win the next one!
Growth comes with supplementary class.


Page 59
Yuuko Kinoshita
I understand. It’s troublesome
but it can’t be helped...


Page 60
Shouko Kirishima
...It’s my win.


Page 61
Miharu Shimizu
Unacceptable! I request a 
rematch!




Page 62
Souichi Nishimura
Accept your defeat gracefully!
And, supplementary lessons to the loser!


Page 63
Miharu Shimizu
That’s even more unacceptable!


Page 64
Shouko Kirishima
...It’s a tie. I’ll definitely
win the next one.


Page 65
Shouko Kirishima
...Principal?


Page 66
Kaoru Toudou
Looks like there's not enough
going on. Leave it to me.


Page 67
Shouko Kirishima
...What have you done?




Page 68
Shouko Kirishima
...a fine card.


Page 69
Shouko Kirishima
...this is a poor card.


Page 70
Shouko Kirishima
...for Yuuji’s sake, I 
must win this.


Page 71
Shouko Kirishima
...there’s no time.


Page 72
Shouko Kirishima
...just a bit more.


Page 73
Shouko Kirishima
Wrong letter used in original?
...Don’t mess around. You 
can’t stop me anymore.


Page 74
Shouko Kirishima
...Zero cash? Let’s think 
of something.


Page 75
Shouko Kirishima
...area conquered.


Page 76
Shouko Kirishima
...I’ll manage this somehow.


Page 77
Shouko Kirishima
...all done.


Page 78
Shouko Kirishima
...they got in my way…
.or 
.... I got hindered...


Page 79
Shouko Kirishima
...There are times like this too.


Page 80
Shouko Kirishima
...Luck is on my side.


Page 81
Shouko Kirishima
...There’s no other way. Let’s
survey the war situation.


Page 82
Shouko Kirishima
...I don’t mind resting many rounds.
As long as I’m together with Yuuji.


Page 83
Yuuji Sakamoto
I refuse to do so even for one round!


Page 84
Shouko Kirishima
...that’s a lie. Yuuji is just too shy 
and said that.


Page 85
Yuuji Sakamoto
Isn’t that only because
you see me as being shy...


Page 86
Shouko Kirishima
...as usual. 


Page 87
Shouko Kirishima
...bad luck.


Page 88
Shouko Kirishima
...you got too arrogant.


Page 89
Shouko Kirishima
...the plan that I’ve set 
up has been spoiled.


Page 90
Shouko Kirishima
られる。
...I can endure this if
It’s only this much.


Page 91
Shouko Kirishima
...the funds for the 
Love nest is...


Page 92
Shouko Kirishima
...let’s start by 
Confirming the route.


Page 93
Shouko Kirishima
If I don’t resupply...


Page 94
Shouko Kirishima
If I don’t purchase 
this quickly...
