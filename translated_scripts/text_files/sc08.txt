Yo hag, I've come for my prize!

You need to ask permission before
entering a room. You perform a greeting,
and business comes last. Go try again.


Page 2
Akihisa Yoshii
Yeaaaah, screw that.
Hurry up and give me my prize!


Page 3
Kaoru Toudou
A person skilled only in making
requests does not a long life live.
But, whatever. Here you go, take it.


Page 4
Akihisa Yoshii
Is this a ring?! H-Hold on a second!
We're moving way too fast! I'm not
ready for this kind of committment!


Page 5
Akihisa Yoshii
I mean, I am still just a high school
student, and you're like, old, and
the principal, and stuff!


Page 6
Akihisa Yoshii
This age gap is just way too big!
I know you're the principal and all,
but I just can't accept it!


Page 7
Kaoru Toudou
This idiot doesn't realize that if he just
knew when to shut his mouth, he
wouldn't get smacked around so much.


Page 8
Kaoru Toudou
I have no idea why you're so confused
about this, but that is the prize that
you requested.


Page 9
Akihisa Yoshii
Wait, this is it? I'm kind of...
surprised, actually.


Page 10
Akihisa Yoshii
So if I use this, it'll protect me from
the damage my avatar takes?



Page 11
Kaoru Toudou
Yep. Though I must warn you, any
blessing can easily turn into a curse.
Nothing in life is ever that convenient.


Page 12
Akihisa Yoshii
I don't really get what's going on, but if
wearing this ring means I don't have to
share my avatar's pain, then who cares!


Page 13
Kaoru Toudou
I see. Do as you wish.


Page 14
Akihisa Yoshii
Alright, here we... go?
I don't really feel any different.


Page 15
Kaoru Toudou
Try summoning your avatar.
Then you'll understand.


Page 16
Akihisa Yoshii
Understand? Understand what?


Page 17
Kaoru Toudou
That ring's effect... Well...
You'll see in a moment, heheh.


Page 18
Akihisa Yoshii
W-Well, here I go! Summon!
That's weird. That should have... Hey!


Page 19
Kaoru Toudou
What's wrong? Is something the matter?


Page 20
Akihisa Yoshii
Not really, but... Owwwww?! Why do
I hurt all over?! What the hell is this?
It's worse than before!


Page 21
Kaoru Toudou
Meddling with nature comes at a price.
Since your avatar won't take damage,
your body will have to bear its burden.


Page 22
Akihisa Yoshii
Wait, what are you talking about?!
I don't get what's going on here!


Page 23
Yuuji Sakamoto
Then I'll step in to lay some knowledge
on you. Akihisa, your body...


Page 24
Akihisa Yoshii
Huh? Y-Yuuji? And Hideyoshi, too?!


Page 25
Yuuji Sakamoto
Remember what you said to Shouko?
Well, thanks to that, my eyes had an...
accident. Let me pay you back in full!


Page 26
Hideyoshi Kinoshita
Allow me, as well. Thanks to you, my
sister had to ''correct'' my behavior. I
think I have twice as many joints, now.


Page 27
Akihisa Yoshii
Th-That seems like it could be pretty
useful. Couldn't that help you with a
bunch of things?


Page 28
Hideyoshi Kinoshita
Oh, I see. In that case, I'll just ask
my sister to double your joints, too.



Page 29
Yuuji Sakamoto
Hold on, Hideyoshi. Before you do that,
let me and him ''settle'' our differences.
Summon!


Page 30
Akihisa Yoshii
Wait a second, Yuuji!


Page 31
Yuuji Sakamoto
Do you really think you can talk your
way out of this? What about that pride
you had in your avatar?


Page 32
Akihisa Yoshii
I can't do anything! Just trying to move
is painful. If I swing my limbs, I'm
afraid I might die!



Page 33
Yuuji Sakamoto
I wonder what would happen if you
tried to run away? C'mon, give it a try
for me, won't ya?


Page 34
Akihisa Yoshii
Thanks, but I think I'll hold off for now!


Page 35
Yuuji Sakamoto
C'mon, what're you saying? I thought
we were best friends. There's no need
to hold back, right?


Page 36
Akihisa Yoshii
I'm not too sure, anymore. Maybe we're
more like former best friends?


Page 37
Yuuji Sakamoto
In that case, I definitely don't need to
hold back!


Page 38
Akihisa Yoshii
Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!


Page 39
Hideyoshi Kinoshita
Looks like Akihisa's had about as much
as he can take. I don't think he could
survive a minute with my sister.

Kaoru Toudou
How does that one saying go? If I
remember right, it went something like:
''An idiot is as an idiot does.''
