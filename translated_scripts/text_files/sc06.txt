This is it! The last one!
If I can just win one more time...!

Yuuji Sakamoto
Sorry, Akihisa, but that won't be
happening. Let's just say I have a
hunch.

Shouko Kirishima
That's right. Our love will conquer all.

Yuuji Sakamoto
Shouko, could you back off a bit?
We're supposed to be opponents
right now, remember?


Page 4
Shouko Kirishima
No, Yuuji. You and I are allies.
Or are you going to stand in my way?

Yuuji Sakamoto
Obviously I'm going to try to win.
There's something I need to get...

Shouko Kirishima
Since it's for our love nest, I
understand. Any time is good.

Yuuji Sakamoto
No way! That's not what I'm-

You're in this round, too?
Then let's work together!

Minami Shimada
I understand how you feel, but what's
in it for me? If we work together,
I'll just end up losing, anyway.

You do have a point... There may not
be anything in it for you, but aren't
experiences their own reward?

Minami Shimada
Not really...

Akihisa Yoshii
But they're supposed to be good for
the heart! Don't you wanna fill your
chest with memories?

Minami Shimada
What the hell is that supposed to
mean?! Now there's really no chance
of me helping you. Prepare to die, Aki!

Wait, what?
Was it something I said?!
