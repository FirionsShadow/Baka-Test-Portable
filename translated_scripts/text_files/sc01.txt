Akihisa Yoshii
Hey, Principal!


Page 1
Yuuji Sakamoto
Yo, hope you don't mind us coming in.

Kaoru Toudou
These damn kids...
Is it really that hard to ask before
barging into someone else's office?

Page 3
Kaoru Toudou
Hm? Looks like it's not just Yoshii and
Sakamoto today. I take it the lot of you
idiots are here to talk about the prize?


Page 4
Yuuji Sakamoto
You got it. Let me just cut to the chase,
then. Can you really give us anything
we want?

Page 5
Kaoru Toudou
As long as it's within reason, yes.


Page 6
Akihisa Yoshii
Is there anything that's off limits?
If I wanted to, say, remove my status
as a probationary student...


Page 7
Kaoru Toudou
Absolutely not. That's your punishment
for being such a massive idiot. It's not
something I can just go and change.


Page 8
Akihisa Yoshii
But...!


Page 9
Kaoru Toudou
No matter what you say, impossible is
impossible. I'm a busy woman, so if
that was all, then get out of my office.


Page 10
Akihisa Yoshii
H-Hold on!


Page 11
Akihisa Yoshii
Could I at least get something so that
I won't get hurt when my avatar takes
damage? I'd be fine with just that!


Page 12
Kaoru Toudou
Hm... I suppose stringing you along could be fun.
This might turn out pretty good, but I doubt even
you could overcome that idiotic brain of yours.


Page 13
Akihisa Yoshii
I may be an idiot, but it's not just me!
You guys are with me, right?


Page 14
Yuuji Sakamoto
Nah, we're out.


Page 15
Kouta Tsuchiya
Later.


Page 16
Akihisa Yoshii
Wait, where are you going?!


Page 17
Yuuji Sakamoto
We don't have any reason to help you.


Page 18
Akihisa Yoshii
What? Why not?!


Page 19
Yuuji Sakamoto
You're not the only one who wants the
reward.

Page 20
Yuuji Sakamoto
Besides, no matter what you do to your
avatar, it won't make you any less
stupid in a Summoner Test War.

Page 21
Akihisa Yoshii
That's not true! If I didn't get hurt every
time my avatar was damaged, I could
totally do 10... no, 100 times better!


Page 22
Yuuji Sakamoto
Does anyone here actually believe that?


Page 23
Minami Shimada
No way.


Page 24
Kouta Tsuchiya
Afraid not.


Page 25
Hideyoshi Kinoshita
Ditto.


Page 26
Mizuki Himeji
Sorry, Akihisa...


Page 27
Yuuji Sakamoto
There you go. Your idea? Rejected.
But don't worry, I'm not heartless. I'll
give this advice as your parting gift:


Page 28
Yuuji Sakamoto
If you dare get in my way, I'll take
some pliers and... Well, I'm sure you
won't miss a few of your fingernails.

Page 29
Akihisa Yoshii
That's not advice! That's torture!


Page 30
Yuuji Sakamoto
Well, beggers can't be choosers.
Later.


Page 31
Mizuki Himeji
I'm sorry, Akihisa, but there's
something I really want...


Page 32
Minami Shimada
Aki, the most you can do is to just try
your best. But if you get in my way...
Werde ich dich foltern.

Page 33
Akihisa Yoshii
What was that, German?
What did she say?

Page 34
Kouta Tsuchiya
She's going to torture you.


Page 35
Minami Shimada
That's right!


Page 36
Akihisa Yoshii
How did you know that?


Page 37
Kouta Tsuchiya
It's common sense. Take that as my
parting gift.

Page 38
Akihisa Yoshii
I don't need your common sense and
parting gifts, I need help! This isn't
funny, guys! Don't leave me all alone!


Page 39
Akihisa Yoshii
They're all gone...


Page 40
Kaoru Toudou
It's common for people's interests to
clash in situations like this. Just do
the best you can for yourself.

Page 41
Akihisa Yoshii
Oh well. I guess they would look after
themselves when there's a prize on the
line. Besides, I'm sure I can win!


Page 42
Akihisa Yoshii
Alright, no point in losing hope now!
No matter what happens, I'll definitely
beat everyone and get that reward!
