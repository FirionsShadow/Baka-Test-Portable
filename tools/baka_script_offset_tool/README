Baka Script Offset Tool
***********************

--------
Overview
--------

This tool is to be used to update the EBOOT.BIN file for Baka & Test Portable (Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu Portable).

When scripts are translated, they are most likely not going to be the same size as the originals. The EBOOT.BIN references the sizes and offsets of each script file contained within the sc.cpk archive. If the sizes and offsets are not correct, the game will crash upon attempting to load the scripts.

This tool updates the EBOOT.BIN file with the proper sizes of the translated script files.

Usage
